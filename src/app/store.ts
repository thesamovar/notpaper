/**
 * Redux Store
 *
 * The store controls the state of the app (e.g. which resources the user has pinned).
 *
 * The state is a Javascript object, split into distinct "slices". Each slice is handled by a reducer.
 * When an action is dispatched to the store, it is passed to the corresponding reducer. The reducer then
 * updates the state based on the contents of the action.
 *
 * The flow of data when a component updates the state:
 * Component -> Action -> Store -> Reducer -> State
 *
 * The flow of data when a component receives state:
 * Component <- Selector <- State
