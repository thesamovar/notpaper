# notpaper (react)

## Requirements
`node`  
`npm`

Installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) should also install npm. You can run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check that
they are installed correctly. `npm` is a package manager for NodeJS, roughly analogous to `pip` (or rather `poetry`).

## Installation

`npm install`

This will install the dependencies from the `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, into `node_modules/`.

## Usage

`npm run start`

This will launch the webapp in your browser. If you make any code changes, they will be automatically re-loaded in the
webpage.
